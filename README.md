# Simple Load More
This jQuery plugin will add a functionality to load 5 (or custom) more items. Best for lists that are long and you want to hide all except first 5 (or custom) and then show a "Load More" button. When that button is clicked, it loads another 5 items.

*Note: this is not AJAX based. It just hides all the items except the first 5 (or custom) and shows another 5 when button is clicked.*

## Options

* `item`: Set the class of the actual items this plugin should take in count.
* `count`: Set the number of items to show at first and load after the button is clicked (if `itemsToLoad` is not set)
* `itemsToLoad`: set the number of items to load. Set to -1 to load all at once.
* `btnHTML`: Set a custom button here.

## Usage

``` JS
$('.some-element').simpleLoadMore({
  item: '.element-item',
  count: 5,
  // itemsToLoad: 10,
  // btnHTML: '<a href="#" class="load-more__btn">View More <i class="fas fa-angle-down"></i></a>'
});
```
